# This sample program demonstrates how to work with the Teradata Database's Character Export Width behavior.

# The Teradata SQL Driver for Python always uses the UTF8 session character set, and the charset connection
# parameter is not supported. Be aware of the Teradata Database's Character Export Width behavior that adds trailing
# space padding to fixed-width CHAR data type result set column values when using the UTF8 session character set.

# Work around this drawback by using CAST or TRIM in SQL SELECT statements, or in views, to convert fixed-width CHAR
# data types to VARCHAR.

company for which you are acting.  The term "Teradata" refers to either Teradata U.S., Inc.
for Software deliveries in the US or Teradata Ireland Ltd. for Software deliveries outside
the United States.  "Software" refers to the software product identified above, which
consists of computer software code in object code form only, as well as associated
documentation that Teradata may elect in its sole discretion to provide you.  "Software"
also includes any and all error corrections, bug fixes, updates, upgrades, or new versions
or releases of the Software (collectively and individually, "Enhancements") that Teradata
may elect in its sole discretion to provide you.

1.  Term.  This Agreement commences on the earliest date of the first download, first
    copying, first installation, or first use of the Software (the "Effective Date").
    Unless terminated earlier as provided herein, this agreement, including your license
    to the Software, will expire or terminate on the same date that your Teradata-authorized
    license to use the Teradata Analytics Platform product expires or terminates (whichever
    occurs first).

2.  License.

(a) Subject to your compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
    and only during the term of this Agreement, Teradata grants you a nonexclusive,
    nontransferable, paid up license to install and use the Software on your computer
    solely for purposes of facilitating your Teradata-authorized license to use the
    Teradata Analytics Platform.  You may make reasonable archival backup copies of the
    Software, but may only use an archival copy in lieu of your primary copy and subject

    or transmit any Software without obtaining Teradata's prior written authorization,
    as well as appropriate governmental approvals, including those required by the
    U.S. Government. Use and or distribution of this software is subject to export laws

    The Government's use, duplication, or disclosure of Teradata's commercial computer

7.  Termination and Expiration. A party may terminate this Agreement with or without
    cause, upon providing written notice to the other parties.  When this Agreement
    terminates or expires, you will immediately cease all use of the Software, permanently
    remove the Software from all computers, destroy all copies of the Software, and (upon
    receipt of Teradata's request) provide a signed written certification that the
    foregoing has occurred. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will survive expiration
    or termination of this Agreement.

8.  Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
    any controversy or claim by negotiation or mediation.  If they are unable to do so, and
    regardless of the causes of action alleged and whether they arise under this Agreement
    or otherwise, the claim will be resolved by arbitration before a sole arbitrator in
    Dayton, Ohio pursuant to the then-current Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration
    Association and the federal substantive and procedural law of arbitration.  The
    arbitrator's award will be final and binding, and may be entered in any court having
    jurisdiction thereof, but may include only damages consistent with the limitations in
    this Agreement.  Each party will bear its own attorney's fees and costs related to the
    arbitration. The obligations to negotiate, mediate and arbitrate shall not apply to
    claims for misuse or infringement of a party's intellectual property rights.  Any
    claim or action must be brought within two years after the claimant knows or should
    have known of the claim.  New York law will govern the interpretation and enforcement
    of this Agreement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
    interpretation and enforcement of the arbitrability of claims under this Section.

9.  Feedback.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary: (a) Teradata will have no
    obligation of any kind with respect to any Software-related comments, suggestions,
    design changes or improvements that you elect to provide to Teradata in either verbal
    or written form (collectively, "Software Feedback"), and (b) Teradata and its
    affiliates are hereby free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques, in
    whole or in part, contained in Software Feedback: (i) for any purpose whatsoever,
    including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing products and/or services
    incorporating Software Feedback in whole or in part, and (ii) without any
    restrictions or limitations, including requiring the payment of any license fees,
    royalties, or other consideration.

10. Confidentiality.  You will not disclose the results of any testing or evaluations,
    including any benchmarks, insofar as it relates to the Software without Teradata's
    prior written consent.

11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties
    with respect to the Software and Services, and supersede all other prior agreements
    and understandings whether oral or written.  No oral representation or change to this
    Agreement will be binding upon either party unless agreed to in writing and signed by
    authorized representatives of all parties. You will not assign this Agreement or your
    rights, nor will you delegate your obligations under this Agreement.  Failure by
    either party to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement will not be deemed
    a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other term or condition. The provisions
    of this Agreement are severable. "Include", "includes", and "including" shall be
    interpreted as introducing a list of examples which do not limit the generality of
    any preceding words or any words in the list of examples.
